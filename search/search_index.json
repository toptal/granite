Now it's time to change our views to allow people to interact with the actions we created.</p> <p>First, we need to add controller methods to call the <code>Rent</code> and <code>Return</code> business actions and create routes for it.</p> <pre><code>class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController\n\n  # a few other scaffold methods here\n\n  # POST /books/1/rent\n  def rent\n    @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])\n    book_action = BA::Book::Rent.as(current_user).new(@book)\n    if book_action.perform\n      redirect_to books_url, notice: 'Enjoy the book!'\n    else\n      redirect_to books_url, alert:  book_action.errors.full_messages\n    end\n  end\n\n  # POST /books/1/return_book\n  def return_book\n    @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])\n    book_action = BA::Book::Return.as(current_user).new(@book)\n      if book_action.perform\n        redirect_to books_url, notice: 'Thanks for delivering it back.'\n      else\n        redirect_to books_url, alert:  book_action.errors.full_messages\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre> <p>And add routes for <code>rent</code> and <code>return_book</code> in <code>config/routes.rb</code>:</p> <pre><code>  resources :books do\n    post :rent\n    post :return_book\n  end\n</code></pre> <p>Now, it's time to change the current view to add such actions:</p> <pre><code>  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;\n      &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;% if book.available? %&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Rent', rent_book_path(book), method: :post %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;% else %&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;(Rented)&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;% end %&gt;\n        &lt;% if current_user &amp;&amp; current_user.renting?(book) %&gt;\n           &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Return', return_book_path(book), method: :post %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;% end %&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', book %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_book_path(book) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Destroy', book, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Do you really want to destroy this book?' } %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now is a good opportunity to introduce projectors.</p> <p>The actual implementation contains a few boilerplate code in the controller that make us repeat a few different logics that are already in the business action.</p> <p>Projectors can help with that. Avoiding the need for creating repetitive controller methods and re-verify preconditions and policies to decide what actions can be executed.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#setup-view-context-for-granite-projector","title":"Setup view context for Granite projector","text":"<p>You'll need to set up the master controller class.
